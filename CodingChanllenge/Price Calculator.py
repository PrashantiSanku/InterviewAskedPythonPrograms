Functional code challenge: Price Calculator
Your Task:
Write a Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

The original price of the item is $75.

The discount is 15%.

Your program should:

Store the original price and discount in variables.

Calculate the discount by dividing discount_rate by  100 and then multiplying by the original_price.

 Calculate the final price by subtracting discount from the original_price.

Print the final price with a clear message.

Expected Output:
The final price after discount is: $63.75
'''

original_price = 75
discount_rate = 15

discount = (discount_rate / 100) * original_price # YOUR CODE HERE
final_price = original_price - discount # YOUR CODE HERE

print("The final price after discount is: $", final_price)
